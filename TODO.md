# To Do
This file lists some goals for the project which haven't been realized
but which are desireable.

* Convert telnet pointers (type '8') to actual telnet links.

* More generally, replace the boolean-based link system with
  one that uses lambdas for generating appropriate hrefs.  Such
  a system could be used to implement telnet links and any other
  kind of link that the standard Gopher protocol mandates.
